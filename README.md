# IGNITION 633

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This repo was created to host the interview task given to me during the Ignition 633 screening. The aim was to design an authentication system to demonstrate how well we understand the authentication flow.

This repository is no intended to be developed upon or used for a future project, it was created strictly for the interview screening process at Ignition 633
